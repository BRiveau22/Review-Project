Review Project Notes

Step 1: Form a group of 3-4 members

Step 2: Develop Program
	Purpose:
	Write a program to successfully evaluate individual
	deliverables from CSC 212 to provide an accurate output 
	of semester course grades
		Examples:
		 - Individual: returns an individual deliverable name and grade
		 - Category: Returns all grades from the category and category total
		 - Course: Ability to return each of the following
			 - All grades within their respective categories and a course overall
			 - Only category totals and course overall
			 - Only the course overall
	 - Comments should be embedded within your code
	 - Successfully compiles accurate output
	 - Use read input to take in grades from an external file
	 - Use write output to write any changes back to your input file

Step 3: Submission
	Primary repository to house your program
		Proof of contribution (commit and push actions made by each group member)
	Brief summary of project
	Evidence of planning
		Pseudocode/flowcharts
	Provide detailed instructions for compiling/using your program	
		CLA
		function / method calls
		
Step 4: Presentation
	Provide a 8-12 minute code analysis
	Describe the different aspects of your code	
		Include how it works and how your group developed your implementations
	Compile your code demonstrating a working prototype
		Must use all possible function/method calls and outputs
	Inputs/Outputs
		Should exemplify the use of three different data sets
		Must show variation and prove the program works under various entry conditions
		
General Guidance
	Include a mock dataset for each group member	
		files, not hard-coded data
	Use only knowledge learned prior to and outside of CSC 212
	Includes the required structures
	Must implement Class structures
	Use vectors rather than arrays
